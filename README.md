# 🪟 Edge-to-Cloud Smart Mosquito Trap for Automated Vector Monitoring

This repository contains the full pipeline for an AI-powered mosquito trap system that integrates **edge computing**, **cloud-based image processing**, and **automated public health surveillance**. Built around a **Raspberry Pi-based trap** and a **Linode-hosted server**, this project enables real-time detection, classification, and alerting of disease-vector mosquitoes.

---

## 🫠 Project Description

The smart mosquito trap uses a **fan and light mechanism** to attract mosquitoes into a chamber where they stick to a pad. A **Raspberry Pi camera** captures **10 multi-focus images** of the sticky pad and uploads them to **Google Firestore (NoSQL)**.

A server-side Python script continuously monitors Firestore for new uploads, and when new data is detected, it triggers a multi-step image processing pipeline to isolate, enhance, and classify individual mosquitoes. If a disease-vector species is identified, it sends **automated alerts** to designated **public health officials**.

### Edge Device (Raspberry Pi)

- Triggers fan + light to lure mosquitoes
- Captures 10 multi-focus images
- Uploads image stack to Google Firestore with metadata

### Cloud Server (Linode)

1. **Undistortion**: Applies fisheye correction to each focus image
2. **Alignment**: Aligns all focus images to the reference (`focus_0`) using ECC
3. **Mosquito Detection**: Applies a trained **Faster-RCNN** model to localize individual mosquitoes
4. **Fusion**: Uses **Laplacian pyramid fusion** or **Gaussian-weighted stack** to combine multi-focus crops into a single sharp image
5. **Deblurring**: Applies either classical (Wiener filter) or deep learning-based methods (DeblurGAN-v2 or MIMO-UNet)
6. **Sharpening**: Enhances anatomical textures via unsharp masking
7. **Classification**: Predicts species label using a fine-tuned **NasNetMobile** model
8. **Alerting**: If a disease-vector mosquito (e.g., *An. stephensi*) is detected, sends email alerts to public health contacts
9. **Storage**: Saves predictions and metadata in **PostgreSQL** for query and dashboard visualization
